# Enhanced SVM-Based Active Learning for Banknote Authentication
This is a sophisticated project demonstrating active and passive learning using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) on the banknote authentication dataset. This project intricately explores the differences between active learning, where data points closest to the hyperplane are iteratively added, and passive learning, involving random data point selection. By employing a Monte Carlo simulation across 50 iterations and analyzing test errors for 90 incrementally trained SVMs, this project provides valuable insights into learning efficiencies in SVMs. It's a compelling showcase of skill in applying advanced machine learning techniques to a binary classification problem, ideal for roles in data science and analytics.
